# ioh-problems-go
Unofficial translation of the [IOHproblem](https://iohprofiler.github.io/IOHproblem/) benchmark to golang.

Currently, our focus has been on translating the [PBO problem set](https://iohprofiler.github.io/IOHproblem/PBO).
Note: We added the knapsack problem as id = 0 to the benchmark.


## TODO
- check why inexact tests fail (no negative evals)
